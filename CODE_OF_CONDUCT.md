# Contributor Code of Conduct
## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We are committed to treating all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

To create a positive and inclusive environment, we expect all participants to adhere to the following standards:

1. Use welcoming and inclusive language.
2. Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.
3. Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
4. Focus on what is best for the community.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We do not tolerate any form of unacceptable behavior, including but not limited to:

1. Use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
2. Insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks.
3. Harassment, both public and private.
4. Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
5. Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Responsibilities

As project maintainers, we are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and taking appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. We may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that we deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and public spaces where individuals represent the project or its community. Examples of representation include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Project maintainers may further define and clarify the representation of a project.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at XXXX. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a manner deemed appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Additional details about enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who fail to follow or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
